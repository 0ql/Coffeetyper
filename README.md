# Donkeytype

### What is Donkeytype?

Donkeytype is a [Monkeytype](https://monkeytype.com) clone that was originally a personal project of mine to test out [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) and [Windicss](https://windicss.org) and now turned into a half decent typing test. 

### Features

- Fast loading time

- Highly customizeble
  
  - Customize all aspects of the Textbox like width, letter spacing, line height, caret width...
  
  - Realtime Theme switching
  
  - Pick between ALL fonts awailable on [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com)

- Settings get saved to local storage

- Save and switch between instances of your Settings in realtime

- All settings apply in realtime; no need to reload (with very few exceptions)

### Usage

To open the Settings move your mouse to the left of the screen.

### Stack

Donkeytype is written in [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) with Typescript and uses Windicss in conjuction with Postcss. 

### Should you use Donkeytype?

It still lacks many features and doesn't come close to the features of Monkeytype. But it provides the most important functions of a typing test and is defenetly useable.
